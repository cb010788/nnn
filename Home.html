            <p class="headpara">Turtles are a group of reptiles that are recognized for their distinctive shell, which protects their bodies. Turtles are found in a wide range of habitats, including freshwater rivers, ponds, and lakes, as well as oceans and estuaries. They have adapted to their environments in many ways, such as developing webbed feet for swimming or strong legs for walking on land. Turtles are also known for their longevity, with some species living for over 100 years.</p>

Sea turtles have a distinctive physical appearance with their large, air-breathing bodies, and shells that consist of an upper part called a carapace and a lower section called a plastron. There are seven species of sea turtles, belonging to two families, Dermochelyidae and Cheloniidae.</p>
                
                <p class="text02">Sri Lanka is home to five of the seven species of sea turtles found in the world, including the Green Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and the Leatherback Turtle. Each year, sea turtles come ashore to nest on the beaches of Sri Lanka, with nesting sites located primarily along the southern and eastern coasts of the island.</p>
                
                <p class="text03">Unfortunately, sea turtles in Sri Lanka face several threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and accidental entanglement in fishing gear. However, conservation efforts are in place to protect these species. The Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Project, for example, works to protect sea turtle nests, educate local communities about sea turtle conservation, and monitor turtle populations.</p>

                <p class="textarea03">Sri Lanka is an important nesting site for sea turtles. The nesting behavior of each species differs slightly, with some species nesting at night, while others nest during the day. Green turtles nest all year round in Sri Lanka, with the highest abundance reported in Kosgoda and Rekawana. Turtle hatching season in Sri Lanka is known to be from November–May. With their peak seasons between January–March. These are some highest abundance turtle nesting beaches reported all over the island.</p>
