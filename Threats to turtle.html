            <p class="headpara">Threats to sea turtles are a serious issue that we need to address. Sea turtles are important members of ocean eco-system, and they help to maintain the balance of marine life. Threats to sea turtles included habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and hunting. Habitat loss can occur when beaches are developed or when coastal areas are destroyed by storms or other natural disasters. Pollution can harm sea turtles when they ingest plastic or other debris, which can cause illness or death. It's important that we take action to protect sea turtles and their habitats so that they can continue to thrive in our Oceana. Spreading awareness about the threats sea turtles face and encouraging others to take action to protect them can help ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="sec001p">Sea turtles face many threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. These threats can cause population declines and even extinction. It's important to take action to protect these amazing creatures. Habitat loss for sea turtles can occur due to beach erosion, coastal development, and other human activities. When sea turtle habitats are destroyed, it can be difficult for them to find suitable places to nest or find food. Pollution can come from many sources, including oil spills, plastic debris, and other types of waste. When sea turtles ingest or become entangled in these pollutants, it can be harmful or even fatal. Climate change can affect sea turtle nesting beaches by causing sea level rise and more frequent and severe storms. This can lead to the loss of nesting habitat. Warmer temperatures can also affect the sex of sea turtle hatchlings, which can impact population dynamics.  Finally, hunting and poaching of sea turtles and their eggs remains a major threat in many areas. It is important to take action to protect these amazing creatures and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

            <h1 class="sec001h1">What can we do ?</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="sec002p">There are many ways to help protect sea turtles. Some things you can do include reducing your use of plastic, properly disposing of trash and recycling, supporting organizations that work to protect sea turtles, and respecting sea turtle nesting areas. You can also help by spreading awareness about the threats sea turtles face and encouraging others to take action to protect them. The most important things you can do to protect sea turtles is to reduce your use of plastic, especially single-use plastics like straws, bags, and water bottles. Properly disposing of trash and recycling can also help reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the ocean. Supporting organizations that work to protect sea turtles through donations or volunteer work can also make a big difference. When visiting the beach, be sure to respect sea turtle nesting areas and follow any guidelines or regulations in place to protect them. Finally, spreading awareness about the threats sea turtles face and encouraging others to take action to protect them can help ensure their survival for future generations.<br><br>Therefore, we are maintaining many turtle hatcheries and rescue centers in Sri Lanka to protect sea turtles and treat injured turtles. You can find out more about our turtle hatcheries and rescue centers through these links.</p>
